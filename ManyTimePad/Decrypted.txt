While the number-field sieve is the best method currently known, there exists an intriguing possibility
This guy's good.
...over the rationals, and hence contained in a single cyclotomic field.  Using the Artin we might
You seeing anybody?
This isn't just about large-number theory. It's about cryptography.
You mean codes?
I mean unbreakable codes.
It would be a breakthrough of Gaussian proportions and allow us to acquire the solution in a dramatical
Are you seeing...
Such an approach is purely theoretical. So far, no one has been able to accomplish such constructions y
The numbers are so unbelievably big, all the computers in the world could not break them down.
But maybe, just maybe, there's a shortcut. I'll bet you anything he's found it.
If he has, you're in over your head. I'll get my coat.
Numbers themselves may be our best tools...
...may be able to see things in other numbers that we can't.

   Congratulations, you have gotten this far.  But you're not done yet!
